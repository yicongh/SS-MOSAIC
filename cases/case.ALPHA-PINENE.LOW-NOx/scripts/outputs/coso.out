 
:: WARNING: setvars.sh has already been run. Skipping re-execution.
   To force a re-execution of setvars.sh, use the '--force' option.
   Using '--force' can result in excessive use of your environment variables.
  
usage: source setvars.sh [--force] [--config=file] [--help] [...]
  --force        Force setvars.sh to re-run, doing so may overload environment.
  --config=file  Customize env vars using a setvars.sh configuration file.
  --help         Display this help message and exit.
  ...            Additional args are passed to individual env/vars.sh scripts
                 and should follow this script's arguments.
  
  Some POSIX shells do not accept command-line options. In that case, you can pass
  command-line options via the SETVARS_ARGS environment variable. For example:
  
  $ SETVARS_ARGS="ia32 --config=config.txt" ; export SETVARS_ARGS
  $ . path/to/setvars.sh
  
  The SETVARS_ARGS environment variable is cleared on exiting setvars.sh.

Matplotlib created a temporary config/cache directory at /tmp/matplotlib-ornykpp_ because the default path (/home/yicongh/.config/matplotlib) is not a writable directory; it is highly recommended to set the MPLCONFIGDIR environment variable to a writable directory, in particular to speed up the import of Matplotlib and to better support multiprocessing.
